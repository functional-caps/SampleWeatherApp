 Exercise 1.
 
 Define a parser combinator, zeroOrMore, that takes a parser of As as input and produces a parser of Array<A>s by running the existing parser as many times as it can.
 
 */



/*
 
 Exercise 2.
 
 Define a parser combinator, oneOrMore, that takes a parser of As as input and produces a parser of Array<A>s that must include at least one value.
 
 */



/*
 
 Exercise 3.
 
 Enhance the zeroOrMore and oneOrMore parsers to take a separatedBy argument in order to parse a comma-separated list. Ensure that only separators between parsed values are consumed.
 
 */



/*
 
 Exercise 4.
 
 Redefine the zeroOrMoreSpaces and oneOrMoreSpaces parsers in terms of zeroOrMore and oneOrMore.
